# Soko

This base template provides a minimal setup to get React, Tailwind, and Prettier Tailwind Plugin working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

It is just a modified template from `npm create vite@latest`.

## Quick Start

To get started, create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir my-new-project && cd my-new-project
```

### Clone the repository

Copy and paste on the terminal:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:shalri/soko.git . && rm -rf .git && git init
```

This will clone the **Soko** repo in your current directory, remove the existing
`.git` directory, and initialize a new Git repository.

### Install dependencies and start dev server

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You're set. Happy coding!
